# Little Lemon app
The Little Lemon app is built to rectify the issue of customers having to visit the Little Lemon restaurant physically to enjoy thier favorite meals, by being able to simply order them online. Their new feature, table reservation, enables customers to book reservations for themselves and their guests, adding ease and comfort to the dining experience.

This project is part of the Meta Frontend Developer Certificate course.
